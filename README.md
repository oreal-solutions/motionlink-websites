# Motionlink Websites

A collection of [Motionlink websites](https://motionlink.co/docs/Installing%20websites). Motionlink allows for the publishing of content from Notion to static websites. These websites must be configured to work with Motionlink. An interesting project we are running is taking some popular open source static websites and configuring them to work with Motionlink. This is a collection of these websites.

Each website has a Notion OS/template. This template must be duplicated into your workspace for Motionlink to install the website and set it up for deployment to Netlify. This process is automatic. Instructions on how to install websites can be found [here](https://motionlink.co/docs/Installing%20websites).

We are still working on allowing for more complex projects. We believe that Notion can be the only dashboard you need. We do not know how exactly yet, but we are slowly making progress.

## About Motionlink

Motionlink is a Notion to static website publishing tool designed with developer freedom in mind. Many Notion-as-a-CMS tools make it possible for teams to turn their Notion pages to websites. This works fine for some cases, but does not give the team complete control over how their website should look, where and how it should be hosted, which tech stack should be used, etc. Motionlink is built to address this with a robust, yet simple, solution... Github workflows. You can learn more [here](https://motionlink.co).
